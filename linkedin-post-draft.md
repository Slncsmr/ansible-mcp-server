# LinkedIn Post Draft for Ansible MCP Server

## Option 1: Technical Achievement Focus

üöÄ Excited to share my latest open-source project: Ansible MCP Server for Claude Desktop!

I've been working on bridging the gap between AI assistants and infrastructure automation. This tool allows Claude to directly manage your infrastructure through Ansible, opening up new possibilities for AI-assisted DevOps.

‚ú® Key Features:
‚Ä¢ 58 tools for comprehensive infrastructure management
‚Ä¢ Support for Proxmox, Docker, systemd, and more
‚Ä¢ Secure JSON-RPC protocol implementation
‚Ä¢ Real-time playbook execution with progress tracking

üîß What makes this special:
Instead of copying and pasting commands, Claude can now directly execute Ansible playbooks, manage containers, configure services, and even handle complex tasks like VM provisioning.

üìä Current Progress:
‚Ä¢ Jest test suite with 84% tool coverage
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive error handling and validation
‚Ä¢ Active development with 20+ planned enhancements

I'm looking for feedback from the DevOps and automation community. What features would make this more useful for your workflows?

## Option 2: Problem-Solution Focus

ü§î Ever wished your AI assistant could actually manage your infrastructure instead of just telling you how?

I built Ansible MCP Server to solve this exact problem. It's a bridge that lets Claude Desktop directly execute Ansible playbooks and manage your infrastructure.

Real example from my homelab:
```
"Claude, deploy a new Nextcloud instance on my Proxmox server"
*Claude creates VM, configures networking, installs Nextcloud, sets up SSL*
"Done! Nextcloud is available at https://nextcloud.yourdomain.com"
```

No more copy-pasting commands or switching between terminals!

üõ†Ô∏è Built for real-world use:
‚Ä¢ Manages my 10+ service homelab
‚Ä¢ Handles everything from DNS updates to full VM deployments
‚Ä¢ Secure permission system for production safety

Looking for early adopters and contributors to help shape this tool. What infrastructure tasks would you want an AI to handle?

## Option 3: Community-First Approach

üëã First post! Sharing something I've been building that might interest the DevOps community.

I created Ansible MCP Server - an open-source tool that connects Claude Desktop with your infrastructure through Ansible. Think of it as giving your AI assistant actual hands to manage servers, not just advice.

üéØ Why I built this:
‚Ä¢ Tired of context-switching between AI chat and terminal
‚Ä¢ Wanted to leverage AI for complex infrastructure tasks
‚Ä¢ Needed a secure way to automate my homelab

üìà Current state:
‚Ä¢ 58 working tools covering most Ansible modules
‚Ä¢ Jest test suite (just migrated from Node.js built-in)
‚Ä¢ Actively used in my homelab with 10+ services

ü§ù Seeking feedback on:
‚Ä¢ Which Ansible modules would be most valuable to add?
‚Ä¢ Security considerations for production use
‚Ä¢ Integration ideas with other tools

First-time posting here, but excited to connect with others working on AI + Infrastructure automation!

## Tips for your first LinkedIn post:

1. **Choose the option that feels most authentic to you**
2. **Add a personal photo or screenshot** of the tool in action
3. **Engage with comments** - LinkedIn rewards active discussions
4. **Post during business hours** (Tuesday-Thursday, 9-10 AM or 3-4 PM)
5. **Tag relevant people** if you know others in DevOps/AI space

## Hashtag strategy:
- Use 3-5 highly relevant hashtags
- Mix popular (#DevOps) with specific (#AnsibleAutomation)
- Include #FirstPost if using Option 3
