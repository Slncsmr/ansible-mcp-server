# TODO: GitHub Feature Requests

## Overview
Convert TODO items into GitHub feature requests for better project management and community contribution.

## Process
1. Review all TODO files in the project
2. Convert each major feature into a GitHub issue with proper labels
3. Create issue templates for different types of features
4. Set up project boards for tracking progress
