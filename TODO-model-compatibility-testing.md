# TODO: AI Model Compatibility Testing

## Overview
Test the MCP server with different AI models to understand capability differences and ensure broad compatibility.

## Primary Test: Ollama Integration
- Test with various Ollama models (Llama 2, Mistral, Mixtral, etc.)
- Document which features work well and which have limitations
- Compare response quality and tool usage patterns

## Testing Objectives
1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Can the model call MCP tools correctly?
   - Does it parse tool responses appropriately?
   - How well does it handle error messages?

2. **Complex Operations**
   - Multi-step workflows (e.g., create VM then deploy service)
   - Error recovery and retry logic
   - Understanding of infrastructure concepts

3. **Service Catalog Usage**
   - Can it browse and recommend services effectively?
   - Does it understand service requirements and alternatives?
   - How well does it generate deployment configurations?

## Models to Test
1. **Ollama Models**
   - Llama 2 (7B, 13B, 70B)
   - Mistral 7B
   - Mixtral 8x7B
   - CodeLlama variants
   - Vicuna
   - Phi-2

2. **Other Open Source Models**
   - GPT4All compatible models
   - LocalAI supported models
   - Hugging Face models via API

3. **Commercial Models** (for comparison)
   - OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-3.5
   - Google Gemini
   - Anthropic Claude (baseline)

## Test Scenarios
1. **Simple Commands**
   - "Show me all VMs on the Proxmox server"
   - "Browse available services"
   - "Get details about Jenkins"

2. **Medium Complexity**
   - "Deploy Nextcloud on a new VM"
   - "Update all servers in the web group"
   - "Generate an inventory from Proxmox"

3. **Complex Workflows**
   - "Set up a complete GitLab CI/CD environment"
   - "Create a monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana"
   - "Discover existing infrastructure and organize it"

## Metrics to Track
- **Accuracy**: Does it use the right tools with correct parameters?
- **Efficiency**: How many attempts to complete a task?
- **Understanding**: Does it grasp the context and requirements?
- **Error Handling**: How well does it recover from failures?
- **Documentation**: Can it explain what it's doing?

## Expected Limitations
- Smaller models may struggle with:
  - Complex parameter schemas
  - Multi-step planning
  - Understanding infrastructure relationships
  - Error interpretation

## Implementation Notes
1. Create a standardized test suite
2. Automate testing where possible
3. Document model-specific quirks
4. Create model-specific prompts if needed
5. Consider creating simplified tool schemas for smaller models

## Compatibility Improvements
Based on testing, we may need to:
- Simplify tool descriptions for better understanding
- Add more examples in tool schemas
- Create model-specific adapters
- Implement fallback strategies
- Add explicit guidance in error messages

## Documentation Output
Create a compatibility matrix showing:
- Model name and size
- Supported features
- Known limitations
- Recommended use cases
- Performance notes

## Note
This is not about replacing any specific AI assistant but about ensuring the MCP server is broadly useful across different AI systems and understanding the capability boundaries of different models.
